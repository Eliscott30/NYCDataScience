    "1. Spend a few minutes determining which data would be most important to use in the prediction problem. You may need to create new features based on the data available. Consider using a feature selection aide in sklearn. But a worst case scenario; identify one or two strong features that would be useful to include in the model.\n",
    "2. Spend 1-2 minutes considering which _metric_ makes the most sense to optimize. Accuracy? FPR or TPR? AUC? Given the business problem (understanding survival rate aboard the Titanic), why should you use this metric?\n",
    "3. Build a tuned Logistic model. Be prepared to explain your design (including regularization), metric, and feature set in predicting survival using the tools necessary (such as a fit chart)."
